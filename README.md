# README

Here we want to create a nvim config that is very nice and feature rich and to my taste

I want a good looking monokai theme i want to use the jetbrains fonts.

I want to make sure i have a document in this directory that details exactly how to use this nvim setup and all the commands a new person to VIM and NVIM to know like what is the leader key and super key and how to do basic things such as browse files and add extensions to help browse files. and how to pull up a terminal and open files and create anew files and how to switch between buffers and make new ones.


I want also an explanation on how to use tmux best with claude cli and nvim to maximize what i can get out of Claude Code, Alacritty, Bash, Neovim, Tmux.

We want a workflow explanation and how to use git properly and quickly from nvim and how we can integrate LSPs and other syntax related features for nvim and so we can have a very fast and responsive nvim design
